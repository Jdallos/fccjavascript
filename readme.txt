A website designed to showcase the code I produced in order to pass the Free Code Camp (FCC) JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures 300 hour certification.

To imporve UI and UX I integrated these algorithms into a form structure to allow user input inorder to test them.

This website was style using Bootstrap5.
